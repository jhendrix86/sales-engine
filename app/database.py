    Automatically scope every ORM SELECT to the current tenant context.

    No-ops whenever no tenant context is set on the current request - the
    same fail-open posture used elsewhere in this fleet (e.g. unkey-auth)
    so existing callers that don't set X-Tenant-ID aren't silently broken.

    Scoped to TenantBase (imported lazily here, not at module level, to
    avoid a circular import - app.models.tenant_base's package __init__
    pulls in app.models.lead etc., which import Base from this
    module) rather than Base itself, so the criteria callable is only
    ever invoked for tenant-scoped entities and never has to branch on
    hasattr(cls, "tenant_id") - a branch whose two return shapes (a real
    comparison vs. an unrelated true()) breaks SQLAlchemy's lambda-SQL
    caching, since the cache key can't tell whether the closure variable
    structurally participates in the returned expression.

    tenant_id is resolved here, once, into a plain closure variable before
    building the criteria lambda - SQLAlchemy's lambda-SQL caching also
    forbids invoking a function (e.g. get_tenant_context()) from inside a
    with_loader_criteria callable, since it normally extracts bound values
    without calling the lambda body at all.
